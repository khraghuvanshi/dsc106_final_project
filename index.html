            <p>
              According to the CDC, <strong>1 in 10</strong> in America have
              diabetes. This means that in any given group of 10, at least one person
              is affected. Understanding glucose levels is crucial for
              maintaining long-term health.

            <h2>Understanding the Data</h2>
            <p>
              We conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to clean and
              structure the CGMacros dataset, which contains continuous glucose
              monitoring (CGM) readings, meal compositions, and participant
              health metrics.

            <p>
              In this section, you can explore how your diet may impact your overall health, specifically whether you might be at risk for diabetes. 
              The data visualization shows clusters based on real-world data of macro-nutrient consumption and glucose responses, helping us categorize different dietary patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
              By entering your own macro-nutrient consumption (carbs, protein, fat, and fiber), weâ€™ll predict which category you are likely to fall into: Healthy, Pre-diabetic, or Diabetic. This prediction is based on where your diet places you within the clusters.
            </p>

            <h2>Different metabolic responses based on health conditions</h2>
            <p>
              Diabetics experience significantly higher and longer-lasting 
              glucose spikes compared to healthy individuals. The interaction 
              shows that healthy individuals experience a small spike after 
              eating but their glucose levels stabilize relatively quickly. 
              In contrast, prediabetics experience a moderate glucose rise, 
              with levels continuing to increase beyond the one-hour mark, 
              suggesting early signs of insulin resistance. Diabetics are even
              worse with the highest spike. Their glucose levels continue to 
              rise sharply after an hour, showing a reduced ability to regulate 
              blood sugar effectively due to insulin dysfunction.

            <h2>Pre-meal glucose matters!</h2>
            <p>
              If pre-meal glucose is already high, the spike is amplified 
              significantly. This pattern mirrors the real-world data where 
              diabetics often start with elevated fasting glucose due to 
              insulin resistance. The higher the starting glucose, the more 
              difficult it is for the body to regulate post-meal spikes, 
              increasing the risk of long-term metabolic complications

            <h2>Not all macronutrients affect blood sugar equally</h2>
            <p>
              Carbohydrates cause the most significant glucose spikes, 
              reinforcing the importance of carb management. This is evident 
              in the visualization where meals higher in carbs lead to a 
              steeper glucose rise, especially in diabetics. In contrast, 
              protein and fat have a more subtle effect as they slow digestion 
              and contribute to a gradual increase in glucose levels rather 
              than a sharp spike. Additionally, BMI plays a role, as individuals 
              with higher BMI levels often exhibit greater insulin resistance, 
              leading to higher and more prolonged glucose elevations.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Diet plays a crucial role in glucose stability, and even small 
            shifts in macronutrient intake can significantly influence diabetes
            risk. Our visualization matters because it transforms complex 
            metabolic responses into an interactive experience, allowing users 
            to see how their dietary choices impact glucose levels in real 
            time. By experimenting with different nutrient compositions, 
            users gain a deeper understanding of their body's response to food, 
            empowering them to make informed decisions for long-term metabolic 
            health.
