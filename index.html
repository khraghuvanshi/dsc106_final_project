      <p>We conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to clean and structure the CGMacros dataset, which contains CGM readings, meal compositions, and participant health metrics. This involved handling duplicate and misnamed columns, ensuring consistent datetime formatting, and addressing missing values. To streamline analysis, we merged individual participant files into a single dataset, enabling efficient comparisons of glucose responses to meals. We also developed an interactive glucose timeline visualization, allowing users to explore fluctuations in real-time. Moving forward, key challenges include optimizing performance for large datasets, accurately aligning meal timestamps with glucose responses, and integrating a machine learning model to predict future glucose spikes based on meal macronutrient composition.</p>
